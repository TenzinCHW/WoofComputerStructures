Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        64 out of   2,860    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          291
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           257 out of     291   88%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               6 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   6

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Place:1108 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <io_dip[23]> is placed at site <P57>. The corresponding BUFG
   component <io_dip_23_IBUF_BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X3Y13>. There is
   only a select set of IOBs that can use the fast path to the Clocker buffer,
   and they are not being used. You may want to analyze why this problem exists
   and correct it. If this sub optimal condition is acceptable for this design,
   you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .ucf file to demote
   this message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue. However, the use
   of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing
   results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the
   design. A list of all the COMP.PINs used in this clock placement rule is
   listed below. These examples can be used directly in the .ucf file to
   override this clock rule.
   < NET "io_dip[23]" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE; >

ERROR:Pack:1654 - The timing-driven placement phase encountered an error.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal spi_channel[3] connected to top level port
   spi_channel(3) has been removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal spi_channel[2] connected to top level port
   spi_channel(2) has been removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal spi_channel[1] connected to top level port
   spi_channel(1) has been removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal spi_channel[0] connected to top level port
   spi_channel(0) has been removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal spi_miso connected to top level port spi_miso has
   been removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal avr_rx connected to top level port avr_rx has been
   removed.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Map:284 - Map is running with the multi-threading option on. Map currently
   supports the use of up to 2 processors. Based on the the user options and
   machine load, Map will use 2 processors during this run.
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network avr_rx_busy_IBUF has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 11 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   io_dip(22)_IBUF,
   spi_mosi_IBUF,
   spi_ss_IBUF,
   spi_sck_IBUF,
   cclk_IBUF
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.260 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
